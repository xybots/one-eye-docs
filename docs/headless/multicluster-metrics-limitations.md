## Limitations

- The collected metrics are available on the observer cluster (for example, from Grafana), but they are not displayed on the One Eye UI.
- If you are using object storage to store the collected metrics, you must configure the compactor manually.
- Currently only metrics are collected from the peer clusters, logs are not.
