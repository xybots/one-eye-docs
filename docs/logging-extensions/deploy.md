Logging extensions are part of the [One Eye](/products/one-eye/) product, and can be deployed using the [one-eye cli tool](/docs/one-eye/cli/). They are automatically deployed when you install the Logging operator with One Eye, for example, using the following command:

```bash
one eye logging install
```
